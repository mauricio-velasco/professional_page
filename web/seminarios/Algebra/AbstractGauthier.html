  <p><strong>Titulo: A Distinguisher-Based Attack of a Homomorphic Encryption Scheme Relying on Reed-Solomon Codes</strong></p>
  <p><strong>joint w/Jean Pierre Tillich and Ayoub Otmani</strong></p>

<div><strong>Abstract:</strong>Bogdanov and Lee suggested a homomorphic public-key encryption scheme based on error correcting codes. The underlying public code is a modified Reed-Solomon code obtained from  inserting a zero submatrix in the Vandermonde generating matrix  defining it. The columns that define this submatrix are kept secret and form a set L. We give here a distinguisher that detects if one or several columns belong to L or not. This distinguisher is obtained by considering the  code  generated by component-wise products of codewords of the public code (the so called ``square code''). This operation is applied to punctured versions of this square code obtained by picking a subset  I of the whole set of columns. It turns out that the dimension of  the punctured square code  is directly related to  the cardinality of the intersection of I with L. This allows an attack which  recovers the full set L and  which  can then decrypt any ciphertext.<br>
