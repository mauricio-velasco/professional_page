  <p><strong>Titulo: &ldquo;</strong>Arithmetic invariants of cubic fields.<strong>&rdquo;</strong></p>
</div>
<div><strong>Resumen: </strong>One of the most natural arithmetic invariants of a number field is its discriminant, an integer that tells us whether or not a prime ramifies. In the case of quadratic fields the discriminant its quite the strong invariant--not only you know ramification behavior from it, but you actually know the field! In higher dimensions the story is not the same so it's natural to consider other invariants which might specify the field. <br>
  In this talk I'll present the integral trace form as a candidate for such an invariant and I'll show some of my results with it for cubic fields. If time allows I'll show how from the study of the trace one obtains the reflection principle on 3-torsion of quadratic class groups, and also some interesting subspaces of  weight 1 modular forms.</div>
